Rahul is going to have tea, so he noticed that in a row there are N number of buns, so he wanted know how many pairs of buns have equal in size,
where each bun have their own size which is denoted with a number, Find rahul to find how many bun are equal in size in that row.

Input description:
Size of buns in a array

Output description:
Number of pairs equal in size

Sample input:
1 1 1 1

Sample output:
6

Explananation:
pair (1,1) are equal, so count->1
pair (1,1) are equal, so count->2
pair (1,1) are equal, so count->3
pair (1,1) are equal, so count->4
pair (1,1) are equal, so count->5
pair (1,1) are equal, so count->6
so the answer is 6

Sample input:
1 2 3 1 1 3

Sample output:
4

Explananation:
pair (1,2) is not equal
pair (1,3) is not equal
pair (1,1) is equal so count->1
pair (1,1) is equal so count->2
pair (1,3) is not equal
pair (2,3) is not equal
pair (2,1) is not equal
pair (2,1) is not equal
pair (2,3) is not equal
pair (3,1) is not equal
pair (3,1) is not equal
pair (3,3) is equal so count->3
pair (1,1) is equal so count->4
pair (1,3) is not equal
pair (1,3) is not equal
So the count is 4
